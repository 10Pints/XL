This utility can be used for saving Excel spreadsheets as tab separated text files
Importantly it can do 2 things that excel save as text file cannot
1: you can saveral workbooks and worksheets 
2: you can save parts of a worksheets which allows you to have 2 areas in a spreadsheet - one lets call it 'Area A' 
for the columns to be saved as text, and the other area 'area B' can fave formulas to generate area A
Area B is not saved
the spreadsheets and their areas are configured using the jason .cfg file
This is WAY better than the standard Microsoft or WPS save as text feature for many reasons
Not you can specify the coulmns and the start row , but leave the end row to be calculated by this app 
So you dont have to keep extending the the no of rows to be saved

You can also tell XL to save all the sheets in a given workbook with a standard column, row configuration to be used for all sheets
This is very useful when you have a variable number of sheets in a workbook.
